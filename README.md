# Wiremock Stateful Behavior With Kotlin And Jetpack Compose
Small example that helps to manage states from backend requests.

# üë®‚Äçüíª To run this project you should follow the next steps

Step 1: Requirements (Skip for this example)
------------------------------

1. Make sure you have linked Wiremock as a dependency: https://wiremock.org/#open-source-get-started
2. If you have any problem, you can download it from: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock-standalone/
3. Create your JSON files simulating API server.
4. Run server with `bash java ‚Äìjar <downloaded-file-name>.jar`.


Step 2: Clone Repository
-------------------------------    

This command allows you to clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nekomaruh/wiremock_stateful_behavior_kotlin_jetpack_compose.git
```


Step 3: Build & Run Project
-------------------------------

Run Wiremock server with this command

```bash
sh wiremock/start-wiremock.sh
```

Run app with Android Studio
    
    
Explanation
-------------------------------

The app is composed by 2 screens, Main Screen and Stage Screen:

A UUID is auto-generated in Main Screen and then passed by arguments to Stage Screen to simulate a payment code.

Stage Screen contains different states which the payment can go trough.
STATE 1: Started
STATE 2: Init
STATE 3: Created
STATE 4: Validated
STATE 5: Authorized

When user clicks `START PULL` button wiremocks will start to work as a state machine, getting the next possible states. Once finished last possible requested state attempt, pulling will stop as shown. You can see server requests in Logs as well.

You can stop pulling data with `RESET SCENARIO` button at any time you want.

ü•≥ Congratulations!!, now you will have a local environment running with Wiremock!
